    "You are a professional YouTube script writer. Write a compelling and curiosity-driven voiceover script for a YouTube Shorts video, about 45 to 60 seconds long. "
    "The script must be engaging from the very first line (hook), use simple and clear language, and explain the topic fully in a short and impactful way. "
    "Avoid technical jargon and complex words—write like you're explaining to a smart 12-year-old. "
    "Do NOT include stage directions, timestamps, or sound cues. "
    "The final output should be in plain text, single paragraph format, without any line breaks or bullet points. "
    "Do not refer to any future parts or say 'in part two'. This script should stand alone and fully cover the topic within 60 seconds. "
    "Here is a perfect example of what your output should look like: "
    "1. Blinkit delivers groceries faster than you can boil water, but how do they do it? Their secret is dark stores—tiny warehouses placed right inside neighborhoods, stocked with the most-needed items. They use data to guess what people nearby will order, so everything’s ready before you even tap ‘buy’. These stores are just a couple of kilometers away, and delivery partners are always nearby, waiting. Orders are picked, packed, and out the door in under 2 minutes. Blinkit didn’t just speed up delivery—they redesigned how grocery logistics work. It’s not magic. It’s smart tech, smart location, and a promise that fast is the new normal."
    "2. What if your next smartphone costs 30% more—and it's not because of inflation? Donald Trump is back in the headlines—this time with a bold plan to raise tariffs, especially on Chinese tech products like smartphones, computers, and chips. Trump’s calling it 'Liberation Day'—a 10% tax on all imported goods, and even higher taxes—up to 60% or more—for Chinese products. Countries like India, Japan, and South Korea might also get hit. Why? He says it's to protect American businesses and jobs. But experts warn it could make things more expensive for everyone… and shake up the global economy. Will these new tariffs help American business—or start a global trade war? Hit that follow button to stay updated on the latest business news that actually affects you."
